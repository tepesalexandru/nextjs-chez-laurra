        This tart is one of my favorite desserts from childhood and the one my
        mother pampers me with most often during the summer. After several
        attempts at various recipes and modulating the ingredients, I came to
        the recipe below, which is neither 100% clafoutis (because it does not
        contain milk), nor pandispan (because the top is much thinner). At the
        same time the countertop is fluffier and more airy than that of a
        clafoutis, but not as tall as that of the pandispanâ€¦ in the end I think
        I could call it "clafouprajiturique"? Is it too French?ðŸ™‚
